Any strategy that\\nomits the effort — whether it's expecting a big launch to get you\\nusers, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect.\\nVector\\nThe need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is\\nso nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking\\nof startup ideas as scalars. Instead we should try thinking of\\nthem as pairs of what you're going to build, plus the unscalable\\nthing(s) you're going to do initially to get the company going.\\nIt could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,\\nbecause now that there are two components you can try to be\\nimaginative about the second as well as the first. But in most\\ncases the second component will be what it usually is — recruit\\nusers manually and give them an overwhelmingly good\\nexperience — and the main benefit of treating startups as vectors\\nwill be to remind founders they need to work hard in two\\ndimensions.
